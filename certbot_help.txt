usage: 
  certbot [SUBCOMMAND] [options] [-d DOMAIN] [-d DOMAIN] ...

Certbot can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates.  By default,
it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing the
certificate. The most common SUBCOMMANDS and flags are:

obtain, install, and renew certificates:
    (default) run   Obtain & install a certificate in your current webserver
    certonly        Obtain or renew a certificate, but do not install it
    renew           Renew all previously obtained certificates that are near expiry
    enhance         Add security enhancements to your existing configuration
   -d DOMAINS       Comma-separated list of domains to obtain a certificate for

  (the certbot apache plugin is not installed)
  --standalone      Run a standalone webserver for authentication
  (the certbot nginx plugin is not installed)
  --webroot         Place files in a server's webroot folder for authentication
  --manual          Obtain certificates interactively, or using shell script hooks

   -n               Run non-interactively
  --test-cert       Obtain a test certificate from a staging server
  --dry-run         Test "renew" or "certonly" without saving any certificates to disk

manage certificates:
    certificates    Display information about certificates you have from Certbot
    revoke          Revoke a certificate (supply --cert-name or --cert-path)
    delete          Delete a certificate (supply --cert-name)

manage your account:
    register        Create an ACME account
    unregister      Deactivate an ACME account
    update_account  Update an ACME account
    show_account    Display account details
  --agree-tos       Agree to the ACME server's Subscriber Agreement
   -m EMAIL         Email address for important account notifications

options:
  -h, --help
    show this
    help
    message and
    exit
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config CONFIG_FILE
    path to
    config file
    (default: /
    etc/letsenc
    rypt/cli.in
    i and ~/.co
    nfig/letsen
    crypt/cli.i
    ni)
  -v, --verbose
    This flag
    can be used
    multiple
    times to in
    crementally
    increase
    the
    verbosity
    of output,
    e.g. -vvv.
    (default:
    0)
  --max-log-backups MAX_LOG_BACKUPS
    Specifies
    the maximum
    number of
    backup logs
    that should
    be kept by
    Certbot's
    built in
    log
    rotation.
    Setting
    this flag
    to 0
    disables
    log
    rotation
    entirely,
    causing
    Certbot to
    always
    append to
    the same
    log file.
    (default:
    1000)
  -n, --non-interactive, --noninteractive
    Run without
    ever asking
    for user
    input. This
    may require
    additional
    command
    line flags;
    the client
    will try to
    explain
    which ones
    are
    required if
    it finds
    one missing
    (default:
    False)
  --force-interactive
    Force
    Certbot to
    be
    interactive
    even if it
    detects
    it's not
    being run
    in a
    terminal.
    This flag
    cannot be
    used with
    the renew
    subcommand.
    (default:
    False)
  -d DOMAIN, --domains DOMAIN, --domain DOMAIN
    Domain
    names to
    apply. For
    multiple
    domains you
    can use
    multiple -d
    flags or
    enter a
    comma
    separated
    list of
    domains as
    a
    parameter.
    The first
    domain
    provided
    will be the
    subject CN
    of the cert
    ificate,
    and all
    domains
    will be
    Subject
    Alternative
    Names on
    the certifi
    cate. The
    first
    domain will
    also be
    used in
    some
    software
    user
    interfaces
    and as the
    file paths
    for the
    certificate
    and related
    material
    unless
    otherwise
    specified
    or you
    already
    have a
    certificate
    with the
    same name.
    In the case
    of a name
    collision
    it will
    append a
    number like
    0001 to the
    file path
    name.
    (default:
    Ask)
  --eab-kid EAB_KID
    Key
    Identifier
    for
    External
    Account
    Binding
    (default:
    None)
  --eab-hmac-key EAB_HMAC_KEY
    HMAC key
    for
    External
    Account
    Binding
    (default:
    None)
  --cert-name CERTNAME
    Certificate
    name to
    apply. This
    name is
    used by
    Certbot for
    housekeepin
    g and in
    file paths;
    it doesn't
    affect the
    content of
    the
    certificate
    itself. To
    see
    certificate
    names, run
    'certbot ce
    rtificates'
    . When
    creating a
    new certifi
    cate,
    specifies
    the new cer
    tificate's
    name.
    (default:
    the first
    provided
    domain or
    the name of
    an existing
    certificate
    on your
    system for
    the same
    domains)
  --dry-run
    Perform a
    test run of
    the client,
    obtaining
    test
    (invalid) c
    ertificates
    but not
    saving them
    to disk.
    This can
    currently
    only be
    used with
    the
    'certonly'
    and 'renew'
    subcommands
    . Note:
    Although
    --dry-run
    tries to
    avoid
    making any
    persistent
    changes on
    a system,
    it is not
    completely
    side-effect
    free: if
    used with
    webserver a
    uthenticato
    r plugins
    like apache
    and nginx,
    it makes
    and then
    reverts
    temporary
    config
    changes in
    order to
    obtain test
    certificate
    s, and
    reloads
    webservers
    to deploy
    and then
    roll back
    those
    changes. It
    also calls
    --pre-hook
    and --post-
    hook
    commands if
    they are
    defined
    because
    they may be
    necessary
    to
    accurately
    simulate
    renewal.
    --deploy-
    hook
    commands
    are not
    called.
    (default:
    False)
  --debug-challenges
    After
    setting up
    challenges,
    wait for
    user input
    before
    submitting
    to CA. When
    used in
    combination
    with the
    `-v`
    option, the
    challenge
    URLs or
    FQDNs and
    their
    expected
    return
    values are
    shown.
    (default:
    False)
  --preferred-chain PREFERRED_CHAIN
    Set the
    preferred
    certificate
    chain. If
    the CA
    offers
    multiple
    certificate
    chains,
    prefer the
    chain whose
    topmost
    certificate
    was issued
    from this
    Subject
    Common
    Name. If no
    match, the
    default
    offered
    chain will
    be used.
    (default:
    None)
  --preferred-challenges PREF_CHALLS
    A sorted,
    comma
    delimited
    list of the
    preferred
    challenge
    to use
    during auth
    orization
    with the
    most
    preferred
    challenge
    listed
    first (Eg,
    "dns" or "h
    ttp,dns").
    Not all
    plugins
    support all
    challenges.

    using.html#
    plugins for
    details.
    ACME
    Challenges
    are
    versioned,
    but if you
    pick "http"
    rather than
    "http-01",
    Certbot
    will select
    the latest
    version aut
    omatically.
    (default:
    [])
  --issuance-timeout ISSUANCE_TIMEOUT
    This option
    specifies
    how long
    (in
    seconds)
    Certbot
    will wait
    for the
    server to
    issue a cer
    tificate.
    (default:
    90)
  --user-agent USER_AGENT
    Set a
    custom user
    agent
    string for
    the client.
    User agent
    strings
    allow the
    CA to
    collect
    high level
    statistics
    about
    success
    rates by
    OS, plugin
    and use
    case, and
    to know
    when to
    deprecate
    support for
    past Python
    versions
    and flags.
    If you wish
    to hide
    this

    always keep
    the
    existing
    one until
    it is due
    for renewal
    (for the
    'run'

    this means
    reinstall
    the
    existing ce

    (default:
    Ask)
  --expand
    If an
    existing
    certificate
    is a strict
    subset of
    the
    requested
    names,
    always
    expand and

    requested
    domains,
    renew it
    now,
    regardless
    of whether
    it is near
    expiry.
    (Often
    --keep-
    until-
    expiring is
    more approp
    riate).
    Also
    implies
    --expand.
    (default:
    False)
  --renew-with-new-domains
    If a
    certificate
    already
    exists for
    the
    requested
    certificate
    name but
    does not
    match the
    requested
    domains,
    renew it
    now,
    regardless
    of whether
    it is near
    expiry.
    (default:
    False)
  --reuse-key
    When
    renewing,
    use the
    same
    private key
    as the
    existing ce
    rtificate.
    (default:
    False)
  --no-reuse-key
    When
    renewing,
    do not use
    the same
    private key
    as the
    existing ce
    rtificate.
    Not reusing
    private
    keys is the
    default
    behavior of
    Certbot.
    This option
    may be used
    to unset
    --reuse-key
    on an
    existing ce
    rtificate.
    (default:
    False)
  --new-key
    When
    renewing or
    replacing a
    certificate
    , generate
    a new
    private
    key, even
    if --reuse-
    key is set
    on the
    existing ce
    rtificate.
    Combining
    --new-key
    and
    --reuse-key
    will result
    in the
    private key
    being
    replaced
    and then
    reused in
    future
    renewals.
    (default:
    False)
  --allow-subset-of-names
    When
    performing
    domain
    validation,
    do not
    consider it
    a failure
    if authoriz
    ations can
    not be
    obtained
    for a
    strict
    subset of
    the
    requested
    domains.
    This may be
    useful for
    allowing
    renewals
    for
    multiple
    domains to
    succeed
    even if
    some
    domains no

  --pre-hook PRE_HOOK
    Command to
    be run in a
    shell
    before
    obtaining
    any certifi
    cates.
    Intended
    primarily
    for
    renewal,
    where it
    can be used
    to
    temporarily
    shut down a
    webserver
    that might
    conflict
    with the
    standalone
    plugin.
    This will
    only be
    called if a
    certificate
    is actually
    to be obtai
    ned/renewed
    . When
    renewing
    several cer
    tificates
    that have
    identical
    pre-hooks,
    only the
    first will
    be
    executed.
    (default:
    None)
  --post-hook POST_HOOK
    Command to
    be run in a
    shell after
    attempting
    to obtain/r
    enew certif

    renewed cer
    tificates,
    or to
    restart any
    servers
    that were
    stopped by
    --pre-hook.
    This is
    only run if
    an attempt
    was made to
    obtain/rene
    w a certifi
    cate. If
    multiple
    renewed cer
    tificates
    have
    identical
    post-hooks,
    only one
    will be
    run.
    (default:
    None)
  --deploy-hook DEPLOY_HOOK
    Command to
    be run in a
    shell once
    for each su
    ccessfully
    issued cert
    ificate.
    For this
    command,
    the shell
    variable $R
    ENEWED_LINE
    AGE will
    point to
    the config
    live subdir

    delimited
    list of
    renewed
    certificate
    domains
    (for
    example, "e

  --disable-hook-validation
    Ordinarily
    the
    commands
    specified
    for --pre-h
    ook/--post-
    hook/--
    deploy-hook
    will be
    checked for
    validity,
    to see if
    the
    programs
    being run
    are in the
    $PATH, so
    that
    mistakes
    can be
    caught
    early, even
    when the
    hooks
    aren't
    being run
    just yet.
    The
    validation
    is rather
    simplistic
    and fails
    if you use
    more
    advanced
    shell
    constructs,
    so you can

    plugin, and
    triggered
    when the
    user
    executes
    "certbot

    regardless
    of if the
    certificate
    is renewed.
    This
    setting
    does not
    apply to
    important
    TLS configu

  --no-delete-after-revoke
    Do not

    after
    revoking
    them. This
    option
    should be
    used with
    caution
    because the
    'renew'
    subcommand

  $CERTBOT_
  ALL_DOMAI

  --manual-auth-hook MANUAL_AUTH_HOOK
    Path or
    command to
    execute for
    the authent
    ication
    script
    (default:
    None)
  --manual-cleanup-hook MANUAL_CLEANUP_HOOK
    Path or
    command to
    execute for
    the cleanup
    script
    (default:
    None)

null:
  Null
  Installer

standalone:
  Spin up a
  temporary
  webserver

webroot:
  Place
  files in
  webroot
  directory

  --webroot-path WEBROOT_PATH, -w WEBROOT_PATH
    public_html
    / webroot
    path. This
    can be
    specified
    multiple
    times to
    handle
    different
    domains;
    each domain
    will have
    the webroot
    path that
    preceded
    it. For
    instance:
    `-w /var/ww
    w/example
    -d
    example.com
    -d www.exam
    ple.com -w 
    /var/www/th
    ing -d
    thing.net
    -d m.thing.
    net`
    (default:
    Ask)
  --webroot-map WEBROOT_MAP
    JSON
    dictionary
    mapping
    domains to
    webroot
    paths; this
    implies -d
    for each
    entry. You
    may need to
    escape this
    from your
    shell.
    E.g.:
    --webroot-
    map '{"eg1.
    is,m.eg1.is
    ":"/www/eg1
    /", "eg2.is
    ":"/www/eg2
    "}' This
    option is
    merged
    with, but
    takes
    precedence
    over, -w /
    -d entries.
    At present,
    if you put
    webroot-map
    in a config
    file, it
    needs to be
    on a single
    line, like:
    webroot-map
    = {"example
    .com":"/var
    /www"}.
    (default:
    {})
